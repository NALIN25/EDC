    <string name="info_">Giving blood saves lives. The blood you give is a lifeline in an emergency and for people who need long-term treatments. Many people would not be alive today if donors had not generously given their blood. Most people between ages of 17-65 are able to give blood. That is why we need more young people to start giving blood .</string>
